Tia Carrere's films have scored more than $750 million in worldwide box office sales, starring alongside actors including Sean Connery, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mike Myers in "Rising Sun," "True Lies" and both installments of "Wayne's World". ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/78bd0085-4532-40cf-909f-d20c8523f698.jpg)

Audiences were first introduced to Tia's vocals in the role of Cassandra in "Wayne's World," also appearing on the film's double platinum soundtrack. Tia went on to release the pop / R&B Warner Bros. album Dream, as well as performing the title song I Never Even Told You in the film "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm."

"These were all wonderful opportunities, but although I was widely known for the rock and roll sound of 'Wayne's World' it's not where my musical heart lies," Tia explains. Ironically, it wasn't until she appeared as a contestant on ABC's "Dancing with the Stars" that she rediscovered her musical path. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/91cad069-606a-46fc-a5ce-1294fbc4e79f.jpg)

"'Dancing with the Stars' is the reason I got back into music," Tia laughs. "I saw all of these world class dancers at the top of their game, doing it because they loved it. I realized I had to return to my first love, music."

Tia began to explore the beauty and warmth of Hawaiian music, allowing her to reflect on her heritage and deep love for the islands. "Voicing the role of Nani in 'Lilo & Stitch' brought me back home. Singing Aloha 'Oe for that film felt so good," she adds, joining forces with childhood friend, Grammy Award-winning producer Daniel Ho to release four albums over five years: hawaiiana, 'ikena, He Nani and Huana Ke Aloha. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/774182a4-04d1-4319-b3ff-6efb9a085bc2.jpg)

_"I hope my music captures the feeling you have when you're in Hawaii, where everything slows down just enough to allow you to savor each moment ... "_

Her first Grammy-nominated album hawaiiana was a collection of Tia's favorite childhood songs. 'ikena featured all new Hawaiian language songs, penned by Ho and Amy Ku'uleialoha Stillman. The record won the Grammy Award for Best Hawaiian Music Album. Tia's next record He Nani incorporates jazz influences. Her second Grammy for Huana Ke Aloha solidified Tia's soulful return to Hawaii, classical piano blended effortlessly with the beauty of the native language. 

"Music has always been a big part of my family," explains Tia on her inspiration behind those albums. "My maternal grandmother sang harmony with her sisters on Hawaiian radio during World War II. My paternal grandfather, although a lawyer by trade, wrote love songs in his spare time. Every family gathering became a homegrown talent show. Anyone who could sing or play an instrument would be expected to share their talent."

"These are beautiful, relaxing albums that invite you to sit back and soak in the spirit of Hawaii. I hope my music captures the feeling you have when you come here, where everything slows down just enough to allow you to savor each moment. I never dreamed of an Oscar when I was a kid, but winning a Grammy... To be recognized twice in the same category by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences is such a wonderful honor." ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/81c17781-d836-49ea-8abf-74930b1e3bc0.jpg)
